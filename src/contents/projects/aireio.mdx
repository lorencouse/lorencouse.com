> ## Short Explanation

Aireio is react web app for finding remote work spaces in cities around the globe. Cities are initially compiled using the Google Places API, with rich place data added via the Open Street Map API. Users are then able to self report details on each workspace, including amenities such as power outlets, wifi, seating, and workspace comfort. This data is then compiled into a 'Deskability' score to help users choose a work space that is right for them.

> ## Project Goals

As someone who is constantly traveling for work, I often find myself in need of a quiet place to work. Whether I'm in a new city or just looking for a change of scenery, I want to be able to easily find a remote work space that meets my needs. That's why I created aireio. My goal was to allow users new discover new co-working centers, libraries, and cafes, and find the perfect place to work wherever they are.

The aireio project uses a range of technologies, including:

- [NextJS:](https://www.nextjs.org/) a React framework for building web applications, used to create the front-end of the aireio app. I chose NextJS for its speed and ease of use, as well as its support for server-side rendering and static site generation in order to make my site discoverable via SEO.
- [TypeScript:](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) a statically typed superset of JavaScript, used to add type checking and improve code quality in the aireio app. I chose TypeScript for its ability to catch errors early and improve the overall maintainability of my code.
- [Supabase:](https://supabase.com/) an open-source Firebase alternative, used to store and manage the data for the aireio app. I chose Supabase for its ease of use and flexibility, as well as its support for real-time data synchronization and user authentication.
- [Cloudflare Pages:](https://www.cloudflare.com/) a cloud-based platform for deploying and hosting web applications, used to deploy the aireio app. I chose Cloudflare Pages for its speed and reliability, as well as its support for custom domains and SSL certificates.
- [Google Places API:](https://developers.google.com/maps) a service that provides rich location data for places around the world, used to compile the initial list of cities for the aireio app. I chose the Google Places API for its comprehensive coverage and detailed place data.
- [Open Street Map API:](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) an open-source map data service. With more niche place information, used to add rich place data to the existing workspaces.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Developing the aireio project has definitely come with its share of challenges. Managing time effectively has been one of the main struggles, especially when working with a team. Coordinating schedules and making sure everyone is on the same page can be tough. Another challenge has been deciding on the materials to use in the game. With so many different options available, it can be hard to decide which technologies and tools will be the most effective in creating the desired gameplay experience.

The team has had to consider a range of factors, including the cost of materials, the level of complexity involved in using them, and the level of immersion and interactivity that they can provide. Finally, finding a good game mechanic that is both engaging and challenging has also been a challenge. The team has had to experiment with different gameplay elements and test them with players in order to find the right balance between challenge and enjoyment.

> ## Lessons Learned

Working on the aireio project has been a fantastic learning experience, and the team has learned a lot of valuable lessons along the way. One of the key lessons learned was the importance of time management. With a tight timeline of just two months, it was essential that the team stay organized and focused in order to complete the project on time.

Another important lesson learned was the value of thorough product research. In order to select the right materials for the game's cards, the team had to do a lot of research to determine the best options for durability, cost, and appearance. This research was essential in helping the team to make informed decisions and ultimately create a high-quality product.

Finally, I learned a lot about the process of creating a game from scratch. From designing and illustrating the game's assets to implementing all of the interactive features, there was a lot of work involved in bringing aireio to life. It was a challenging and rewarding process, and the team learned a lot about what it takes to create a successful game. Overall, working on the aireio project has been a fantastic learning experience, and I am very proud of the final product.
