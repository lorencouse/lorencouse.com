> ## Short Explanation

Duplicate Track Deleter is a MacOS utility made with SwiftUI for cleaning up your digital audio library. It supports for the most popular audio files, including MP3, AAC, & WAV.

> ## Motivations

As someone who love to listen to music, I have a lot of audio files on my computer. I often find myself with duplicate audio tracks that take up unnecessary space. The problem is that these tracks often have slight name differences, or varying audio bit-rates. I wanted to create a tool that could help me identify and delete these duplicate tracks and help me organize my audio library.

I did this project originally for my personal use. My goal is to create a comprehensive tool that others can also use to help manage their audio library.

- **SwiftUI:** a modern way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms, used to create the front-end of the Duplicate Track Deleter app. I chose SwiftUI for its ease of use and flexibility, as well as its support for declarative syntax and live previews to help me quickly build and test my UI.

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** allows users to easily add audio files to the app by dragging and dropping them onto the app window.
- **Duplicate Detection:** scans audio files for duplicates based on audio properties such as file name, duration, and bit-rate.
- **Preview and Delete:** allows users to preview duplicate tracks and select which tracks to delete from their library.
- **Customizable Settings:** lets users customize the duplicate detection criteria and choose which audio properties to compare when identifying duplicates.

> ## Future Plans

- **Update Missing Meta Data:** add support for updating missing metadata in audio files, such as artist, album, and genre information.
- **UI Improvements:** improve the user interface with more interactive elements and visual feedback to make the app more user-friendly.
- **Windows and Linux Support:** expand the app to support Windows and Linux platforms to reach a wider audience of users.

I plan to continue working on the Duplicate Track Deleter app and add new features and improvements based on user feedback and my own ideas for how to make the app even better. I hope that the app will help others manage their audio libraries and free up space on their devices by identifying and deleting duplicate tracks.
