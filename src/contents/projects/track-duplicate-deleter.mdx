> ## Short Explanation

Track Duplicate Deleter is a MacOS utility made with SwiftUI for cleaning up your digital audio library. It supports for the most popular audio files, including MP3, AAC, & WAV.

> ## Motivations

As someone who love to listen to music, I have a lot of audio files on my computer. I often find myself with duplicate audio tracks that take up unnecessary space. The problem is that these tracks often have slight name differences, or varying audio bit-rates. I wanted to create a tool that could help me identify and delete these duplicate tracks and help me organize my audio library.

I did this project originally for my personal use. My goal is to create a comprehensive tool that others can also use to help manage their audio library.

> ## Tech Stack Used

<TechIcons techs={['swift', 'macos']} />

- **SwiftUI:** a modern way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms, used to create the front-end of the Track Duplicate Deleter app. I chose SwiftUI for its ease of use and flexibility, as well as its support for declarative syntax and live previews to help me quickly build and test my UI.
- **CoreAudio:** a framework for working with digital audio data in macOS, used to read and analyze audio files in the Track Duplicate Deleter app. I chose CoreAudio for its comprehensive support for audio file formats and its ability to extract metadata and audio properties from audio files.
