> ## Short Explanation

Rise & Shine is an iOS app built with SwiftUI that wakes you up with the sunrise. The app uses your location to determine the time of sunrise and allows you to decide how long before or after sunrise to wake up each day. Users then set a target number of hours of sleep each night. Rise & Shine then calculates the optimal time to sleep and wake you up each morning, ensuring you wake up feeling refreshed and energized and get the most sunlight out of your day.

> ## Tech Stack Used

- [SwiftUI:](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) a modern way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms, used to create the front-end of the Rise & Shine app. I chose SwiftUI for its ease of use and flexibility, as well as its support for declarative syntax and live previews to help me quickly build and test my UI.
- [SunriseSunset API:](https://sunrisesunset.io/api/) a free API that provides sunrise and sunset times for any location in the world, used to determine the time of sunrise for the Rise & Shine app. I chose the SunriseSunset API for its comprehensive coverage and accurate sunrise data.

We actually won 2 categories which are

- **Sustainability: Runner Up**
- **Best Use of Auth0**

We won a $150 cash prize and some swags ðŸ¤‘. This is actually my first time winning a hackathon ([last hackathon](https:///images.com/projects/love4heroes) I only won the Deloitte Challenge), and I'm really happy about it. In the uni, I'm not the type of person that likes to compete in several competitions. Hackathon is an exception, it is super fun to create an application at such a fast pace while still considering the quality

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Definitely, time is a problem, but Rizqi (front-end) and I, sprinted all of the UI and layout in just about 12 hours, we constantly work in a Zoom call so the process is fairly quick. I also use my [Starter Repo](https://github.com//images/ts-nextjs-tailwind-starter) which helps a lot to get it started.

We also have some quirks about authentication with Auth0, because it is normally used with Node.js environment, and our backend team is using Laravel, so they need some time to implement the features.
