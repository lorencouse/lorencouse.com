> ## Short Explanation

I started MaleQ in 2012 as a passion project. What began as a small gay mens' sexual health and wellness blog grew into a full e-commerce platform selling adult products to customers around the globe.

> ## Business Overview

MaleQ (MQ) was founded with the goal to provide answers to those hard to ask questions in the gay community. Growing up in the early 2000s, there was little comprehensive information online about gay men's sexual education. I began MQ by composing articles of my experiences, and the knoledge I had gathered, in the hopes to help other gay men to have safe, and satisfying sex lives.

What started as a a small hobby blog quickly gained popularity, with an increase in readership month on month. I quickly found a niche market for lube, condoms, and male sex toys which seamlessly tied with the topics I was covering already. This allowed me to work on MQ full time, expanding it to a successful, revenue generating e-commerce business.

> ### Achievements

- **Drove Revenue Growth:** Built and managed an e-commerce business generating over **$850K in sales**.
- **Leverages Organic Site Traffic:** Grew monthly traffic to **over 10k visitors** through SEO and content marketing.
- **Managed Global Team:** Led a diverse team of writers and **employees across 5 countries**, expanding user base to Chinese and Spanish speaking markets.
- **Automated Fulfillment:** Implemented WooCommerce and partner APIs to automate order fulfillment, reducing manual labor and **increasing fulfillment speed by 5x**.
- **Site Redesign:** Overhauled site design and branding, increasing user engagement and sales conversion rates.
