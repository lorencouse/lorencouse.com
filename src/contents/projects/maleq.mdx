> ## Short Explanation

I started MaleQ in 2012 as a passion project. What began as a small gay mens' sexual health and wellness blog grew into a full e-commerce platform selling adult products to markets around the globe.

> ## Business Overview

MaleQ (MQ) was founded with the goal to provide answers to those hard to ask questions in the gay community. Growing up in the 90s and early 2000s, there was little comprehensive information online about gay men's sexual health education. I began MQ by composing articles of my experiences, and the knoledge I had gathered, in the hopes to help other gay men to have safe, and satisfying sex lives.

What started as a a small hobby blog quickly gained popularity, with an increase in readership month on month. I quickly found a niche market for lube, condoms, and male sex toys which seamlessly tied with the topics I was covering already. This allowed me to work on MQ full time, expanding it to a successful, revenue generating e-commerce business.

> ## Company Milestones

Over the last 12 years, MQ has slowly expanded to reach a wider audience, and be a more effective and efficient business. Here are some major MaleQ milestones.
