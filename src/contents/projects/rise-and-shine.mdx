> ## Short Explanation

Rise & Shine is an iOS app built with SwiftUI that wakes you up with the sunrise. The app uses your location to determine the time of sunrise and allows you to decide how long before or after sunrise to wake up each day. Users then set a target number of hours of sleep each night. Rise & Shine then calculates the optimal time to sleep and wake you up each morning, ensuring you wake up feeling refreshed and energized and get the most sunlight out of your day.

> ### Motivations

I created Rise & Shine to solve a problem I had in my own life. I wanted to maximize the amount of natural light I got each day to improve my sleep quality and circadian rhythm. I found that waking up with the sunrise helped me feel more alert and energized throughout the day, and I wanted to share that experience with others. I also wanted to learn SwiftUI and build an app that combined my interests in health and wellness with my interest in learning native iOS development.

</div>

- [SwiftUI:](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) a modern way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms, used to create the front-end of the Rise & Shine app. I chose SwiftUI for its ease of use and flexibility, as well as its support for declarative syntax and live previews to help me quickly build and test my UI.
- [SunriseSunset API:](https://sunrisesunset.io/api/) a free API that provides sunrise and sunset times for any location in the world, used to determine the time of sunrise for the Rise & Shine app. I chose the SunriseSunset API for its comprehensive coverage and accurate sunrise data.

- **UI Improvements:** Add more customization options for the user interface, including themes and color schemes.

> ## What I Learned

Building Rise & Shine was a great learning experience for me. I learned how to use SwiftUI to create a modern and intuitive user interface, as well as how to integrate with external APIs to provide real-time data to the user. I achieved my goal of building an app that combined my interests in health and wellness with my interest in learning native iOS development, resulting in an app that I use every day in my own life.
