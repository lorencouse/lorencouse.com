> ## Short Explanation

Canker Core is a NextJS based webapp designed for logging and tracking canker sores. Users create a personal account to track, treat, and manage their oral health in one easy place. The app features a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to log their canker sores, on a visual diagram of the mouth, and track the size, pain level, and location of sores over time.

> ## Project Goals

I designed canker core to help better understand my own oral health and to provide a simple and easy-to-use tool for others to do the same.

- **NextJS:** I chose NextJS for its speed and ease of use, as well as its support for server-side rendering and static site generation in order to make my site discoverable via SEO.
- **TypeScript:** I chose TypeScript for its type checking and ability to catch errors early, and to improve the overall maintainability of my code.
- **TailwindCSS:** I chose TailwindCSS for its utility-first approach to styling, as well as its support for responsive design and custom theming.
- **Supabase:** I chose Supabase for its ease of use and flexibility, as well as its support for real-time data synchronization and user authentication.
- **Vercel:** Vercel was a great fit thanks to its speed and reliability, and simple deployment process. As my site is relatively small, with low traffic, Vercel was an easy, cost effective solution.

Below are some of the key features of the Canker Core project:

- **User Authentication:** users can create an account, log in, and log out of the app.

- **Notes and Photos:** allow users to add notes and photos to each canker sore entry to help them better track and manage their oral health.
- **Treatment Tracking:** allow users to track treatments and remedies used for each canker sore, and view the effectiveness of each treatment over time.

> ## Conclusion

I am proud of the work I have done on the Canker Core project, and I am excited to continue working on it and adding new features and improvements in the future. I hope that the app will help others better understand and manage their oral health, and provide a valuable resource for those suffering from canker sores.
