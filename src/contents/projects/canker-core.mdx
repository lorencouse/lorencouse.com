> ## Short Explanation

Canker Core is a React based webapp for logging and tracking canker sores. Built with NextJS, Firebase, and Vercel.

> ## Project Goals

This project objective is to give information and guide the user to
register for the competitions and the other pre-event through google
forms. There are four kinds that are developed in the website which
are Landing Page to give the user general knowledge about the event.
Then, there are 7 competitions that were made into different routes
each one. Lastly is the pre-event such as the talk show.

This project was made using Next.js and Tailwindcss. Although this is
fairly only a static website that didn't really need much complexity,
using Next.js really simplifies the routing of the website and help me
make reusable components. I usually use tailwindcss when using the
Next.js framework to increase productivity.

> ## Spotlight

### Open Graph & SEO Optimization

The spotlight on this project that I spend some time on SEO and I got
into opengraph where you can get a link preview with a custom
description and opengraph image.

### Animation

I also implemented some animation on this website using the GSAP
library. It was my first time using GSAP on React projects.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

In this project, the problem that I found was that the domain that was
given and needed to use its old and kind of hard to configure.
Eventually, I only host the static files and ditch out the Image
Optimization feature from Next.js. It was not ideal, because I need to
optimize images that are being used to increase loading speed.

I also struggled with implementing ScrollTrigger with GSAP because
there are not many blogs or tutorials on Google, so I take the chance
on reading the documentation to make it work.

> ## Lessons Learned

This is my first website for an event so I really consider a lot how
to do a great practice on SEO, I discovered a library called
[next-seo](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo)
that helped a lot on configuring SEO using Next.js.

In this project, I anticipated that there will be many revisions
because that is what usually happens, so I try to reduce writing HTML
and make everything based on the data, so I store the data in a
javascript file and just map it out to the layout. This makes revising
much quicker and easier.

This project really taught me a lot about making a cleaner code and
make the development process more effective by using some library that
helps.
