> ## Short Explanation

Canker Core is a NextJS based webapp designed for logging and tracking canker sores. Users create a personal account to track, treat, and manage their oral health in one easy place. The app features a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to log their canker sores, on a visual diagram of the mouth, and track the size, pain level, and location or sores over time.

- **NextJS:** I chose NextJS for its speed and ease of use, as well as its support for server-side rendering and static site generation in order to make my site discoverable via SEO.
- **TypeScript:** I chose TypeScript for its type checking and ability to catch errors early, and to improve the overall maintainability of my code.
- **TailwindCSS:** I chose TailwindCSS for its utility-first approach to styling, as well as its support for responsive design and custom theming.
- **Supabase:** I chose Supabase for its ease of use and flexibility, as well as its support for real-time data synchronization and user authentication.
- **Vercel:** Vercel was a great fit thanks to its speed and reliability, and simple deployment process. As my site is relatively small, with low traffic, Vercel was an easy, cost effective solution.

> ## Future Plans

- **Treatment Recommendations:** add support for providing treatment recommendations based on the size, pain level, and location of canker sores.
- **Blog and Community Forum:** add a blog and community forum to the app to provide users with additional resources and support for managing their oral health.
- **Online Store:** add an online store to the app to allow users to purchase oral health products, remedies, and treatments directly from the app.

Users can also add notes, photos, and treatments to each entry, and view detailed statistics and trends to help them better understand their oral health.
