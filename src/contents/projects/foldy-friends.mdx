> ## Short Explanation

After a visit to China, I noticed a new trend of origami and paper folding kits. There were multiple stores selling ornate finished pieces, and DIY kits that were very popular with tourists. I identified a gap in the market for an online store that sold similar products in the US. I created Foldy Friends to fill that gap, and provide a fun and creative outlet for people of all ages. This also allowed me the perfect opportunity to build a full stack e-commerce site using NextJS, Firebase, and Vercel.

> ## Demo Video

Here is a short video demo of the Foldy Friends website and its features:

> ## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with NextJS, after using vanilla React for a number of years. I wanted to build a full stack e-commerce site that would allow me to learn more about server-side rendering, static site generation, and SEO optimization. Coming from WooCommerce, and my previous expereince with my MaleQ business, I wanted to build a site that was more lightweight and easier to maintain.

- [NextJS:](https://www.nextjs.org/) I chose NextJS for its speed and ease of use, as well as its support for server-side rendering and static site generation in order to make my site discoverable via SEO.
- [TypeScript:](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) I chose TypeScript for its type checking and ability to catch errors early, and to improve the overall maintainability of my code.

- [Vercel:](https://www.vercel.com/) Vercel was a great fit thanks to its speed and reliability, and simple deployment process. As my site is relatively small, with low traffic, Vercel was an easy, cost effective solution.
