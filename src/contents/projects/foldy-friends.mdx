> ## Short Explanation

After a visit to China, I noticed a new trend of origami and paper folding kits. There were multiple stores selling ornate finished pieces, and DIY kits that were very popular with tourists. I identified a gap in the market for an online store that sold similar products in the US. I created Foldy Friends to fill that gap, and provide a fun and creative outlet for people of all ages. This also allowed me the perfect opportunity to build a full stack e-commerce site using NextJS, Firebase, and Vercel.

- [NextJS:](https://www.nextjs.org/) I chose NextJS for its speed and ease of use, as well as its support for server-side rendering and static site generation in order to make my site discoverable via SEO.
- [TypeScript:](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) I chose TypeScript for its type checking and ability to catch errors early, and to improve the overall maintainability of my code.
- [Firebase:](https://firebase.google.com/) I chose Firebase for its ease of use and flexibility, as well as its support for real-time data synchronization and user authentication.
- [Vercel:](https://www.vercel.com/) Vercel was a great fit thanks to its speed and reliability, and simple deployment process. As my site is relatively small, with low traffic, Vercel was an easy, cost effective solution.
- [DaisyUI:](https://daisyui.com/) DaisyUI is a component library for Tailwind CSS that I used to quickly build and style components for the Foldy Friends website. I chose DaisyUI for its ease of use and flexibility, as well as its support for a wide range of components and utilities.
- [Stripe API:](https://stripe.com) Stripe was an easy fit for my project as a payment processing platform that allows me to accept payments. I chose Stripe for its ease of use and flexibility, as well as its support for secure payment processing and fraud prevention.
